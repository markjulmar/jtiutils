## jtiutils

The JulMar Utilities (JTIUtils) library is a C++ class library with a collection of useful classes and structures. It has been collected and extended over the years to have common things that I have found useful in private product development. This library is usable with Microsoft Visual C++ .NET (any version) but has not been tested with any other compiler.
